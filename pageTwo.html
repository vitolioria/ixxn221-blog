		<center><h4> During the lecture part of today's session, we were introduced to assignment one and what the main focus and takeaway should be. During the first assignment, the main focus will be trying to understand the intended users and determining what the website's goals are. To practice, we gathered in groups to create personas which allowed us to dig deeper into user aspects such as the demographic, their personal goals, barriers they may face etc. </h></center>
		<center><h4>This is an important practice for future use as it allows designers to understand and empathise with intended users. Understanding the intended demographic, allows us to create websites and different types of outcomes that work well and meet the user's standards and expectations. To make note, the assignment becomes and acts as a plan for the upcoming assignments which will help us decide how the user outcome should be.</h4></center>
		<center><h4>We were able to get a brief lesson on the history of web design from 1990-1998, which allowed us to see an overview of what has changed throughout the years and for us to compare what web design is like now. 

			For the coding lecture this week, we were introduced to how we should store our HTML files while also being taught the basics of different header/paragraph sizes and how to input an image.
