		<center><h4> Throughout this course, I was able to learn many new topics that can help me improve how to become a better web designer and how to create websites for an overall positive user experience. 
		<br><br>During assignment one, I was able to focus on a specific demographic. By doing this I was able to look into what the needs are of this user base and what could be implemented to create a positive experience for them. I was able to produce these findings in different visual displays that are heavily used in UX design.

        <br><br>Within assignments 2.1 and 2.2 I was able to reflect on my findings and produce these onto web wireframes and website development. In 2.1 I developed the ideas from assignment one into Figma and allowed myself to get feedback from tutors to see what should be developed more or not. With 2.2 I was able to show the improvements from before onto editor x. Throughout these assignments, I was able to improve my development skills. I was able to create many prototypes with different functions which give user testers more options to look through and see what actually works for them and what doesnâ€™t. This again can help me with improving the user base experience with the product.
        <br><br>This assignment (coding blog) has allowed me to build my coding skills from my limited knowledge beforehand. Although not the best, I have been able to bring my coding knowledge and display it as blog posts. For future reference, I will carry on with learning HTML and CSS as I have actually enjoyed learning this coding language compared to others.
