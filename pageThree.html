		<center><h4> The focus for this week is goals for both the intended users and the designers. When setting goals, they can be split into two categories; Qualitative and quantitative goals.

			In web design, qualitative goals focus on the quality of the user experience, such as improving user satisfaction and ease of use whereas quantitative goals are measurable, like increasing website traffic or click-through rates. Having a balance between these goals is essential for a successful website, combining usability and measurable outcomes to create a user-friendly site that achieves its intended results.  
			</h4></center>
		<center><h4>When it comes to user and designer goals there can be a clear difference between the two while also having shared similarities. Designer goals are what we want to aim to accomplish and increase engagement whereas user goals are what they want to achieve etc. </h4></center>
		<center><h4>If a person has a negative website experience with a company they will most likely not go to both the company and website. “The experience of the brand is just as important as what it sells”.
			These goals can be presented as a Venn diagram which can help us visualise the differences and similarities from both designer and user goals.
			 
			<br>The coding lecture for this week taught us the differences with un/ordered lists and how to implement hyperlinks. This can help me with future reference when needing to list different items and adding in different site linkswhen wanting to reference something.</h4></center>
