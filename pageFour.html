		<center><h4> Focusing on what we learnt from customer journey maps, this is a format and visualisation of the steps necessary when going forward with the output we want to achieve. Most journey maps are created in a timeline format from the start of the journey, all the way to the end of the journey. We learnt the different components of a customer journey map such as the following: 
			</h4></center>
           <center> <h4><ul>
                <li>Stages of the journey</li>
                <li>Activities</li>
                <li>Emotions</li>
                <li>Experiences</li>
                <li>And expectations</li>
            </ul></h4></center> 

		<center><h4>The use of customer journey maps helps us as designers understand user behaviours, emotions, and pain points within the different interaction stages. This allows designers to empathise with users and make improvements accordingly so that the experience is overall positive.
        </h4></center>
		<center><h4>We were also taught what user flows are and how this tool is used from a UX standpoint. User flows are able to provide a visual step-by-step representation of how the intended users would navigate through the output. This tool is able to have designers pinpoint the different issues and confusion that users could encounter. </h4></center>
			<center><h4>This week's coding lecture introduced us to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). We are able to access HTML elements which ultimately allows us to alter the way components look such as colours, sizing etc. CSS box models can be seen as a ‘box’ that surrounds and wraps around HTML components. Box models can include: <br>
                <br>Margins, Borders, Padding and the content that we want to ‘box’ up.
