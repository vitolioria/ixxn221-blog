            <center><h4>Colors are crucial for the appearance of a webpage. CSS offers a range of color options in different formats. These color values can be applied to change the color of elements or their backgrounds on a webpage. To do this, CSS employs the "color" property, which allows us to define the text color or background color of an element. <br>

                Typography is a fundamental aspect of web design. It involves selecting and styling fonts to enhance the visual appeal, readability, and user experience of a website. A web designer's choice of typography can convey a brand's personality, establish hierarchy, and guide user attention. Proper use of fonts, font sizes, spacing, and alignment can significantly impact how users perceive and interact with a site. This can also act as a role in making websites accessible to a broader audience.
                This knowledge is important to learn and improve on as I carry on in the journey of becoming a web designer.
