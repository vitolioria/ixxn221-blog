		<center><h4> The CSS grid layout module is a helpful and useful coding tool for organizing and arranging content on a webpage. It's like using tables to structure your content into columns and rows, but it's much more versatile. With CSS grid, we are able to create complex layouts, defining how different parts of your webpage should be sized, positioned, and layered in relation to each other. It's not limited to a rigid table structure, and it allows elements within a grid to overlap and stack on top of each other, much like when you position elements using CSS.

            <center><h4>We can use different properties to help create grids. These can include (and are not limited to):
                <ul>
                    <li>grid-template-columns: defines the line names and track sizing functions of the grid columns.</li>
                    <li>grid-template-rows: defines the line names and track sizing functions of the grid rows.</li>
                    <li>grid-template-areas: specifies named grid areas, establishing the cells in the grid and assigning them names.</li>
                    
                </ul></h4></center>
