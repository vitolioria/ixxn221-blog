				<center><h4>During the first week, we went through brief introductions from both course tutors as well as with other students taking the course.<br> <br>Was able to get a course overview which included brief examples of what to expect from assignments and what the outcome should generally be like. </h4></center>
				<center><h4>Although it was a quick class, I think it is important to set personal goals while preparing for the course. <br><br>As I aim to become a UX designer, UX design involves understanding user needs, organizing information, testing designs, and making them user-friendly for the intended audience. <br><br> Because of this, I think it is important to try and stay on top of my work so that, not only am I able to keep up with other courses but to also spend more time submitting assignments that are up to standard and become more understanding of UX practices etc.</h4></center>
